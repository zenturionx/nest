# nest
## Little introduction to Typescript

This section is intended to give you a basic understanding of TypeScript with the idea of familiarizing you with common concepts used on a day-to-day basis with Nest.

Here we will see:

- basic types
- Interfaces
- Implementations
- Classes
- adapter pattern
- Liskov substitution principle
- dependency injection
- Getters
- asynchronous methods
- Class and method decorators

It is important to remember that: this is not an introduction to TypeScript, these are concepts that I need to expose because we will be using them in the Nest course.
